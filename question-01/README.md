# Replication Materials: _To BMW or Not to BMW: Automobile Customer Satisfaction and Brand Reputation_

Replication materials for Bi and Park "To BMW or Not to BMW: Automobile Customer Satisfation and Brand Reputation," Review of Social Economy, 2025

> __Abstract:__
> This article analyzes customer satisfaction surveys over time across inexpensive and premium automotive products and automobiles based on reputation and perceived value of branding. We upend existing literature and models that focus on short-term customer satisfaction by showing that long-term satisfaction reverses from short-term negative satisfaction to become positive. We measure the effect of confirmation bias, which initially wanes, over time and for cases of both product overperformance and product breakdown.
